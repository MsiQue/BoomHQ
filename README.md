# BoomHQ: Learning to Boost Multiple Hybrid Queries on Vector DBMSs

This repository contains the official code for the paper **BoomHQ: Learning to Boost Multiple Hybrid Queries on Vector DBMSs**.  
It includes scripts for **benchmark generation**, **hybrid query construction**, and **learning-based query optimization** on multiple vector database systems.

## 🧩 Benchmark Generation

To evaluate hybrid queries that involve **multiple vector columns** and **scalar constraints**, we design a benchmark based on both **vector-only** and **text-to-vector** datasets.  
The following table summarizes all datasets used in our experiments:

| Dataset   | Type | #Samples  | Dim  | Link                                                         |

## 🧮 Column Expansion for Hybrid Queries

Since our target task involves **weighted nearest-neighbor queries** across multiple vector columns combined with **scalar filtering conditions**,  
we designed a **column expansion mechanism** to generate realistic hybrid data schemas from the above datasets.

- **Scalar Column Expansion** — implemented in [`gen_scalar_column.py`](./gen_scalar_column.py)  
  This script adds synthetic or derived scalar attributes (e.g., price, rating, category) to simulate hybrid query conditions.

- **Vector Column Expansion** — implemented in [`gen_vector_column.py`](./gen_vector_column.py)  
  This script creates additional semantic vector columns by applying embedding models (e.g., BERT) to text fields, enabling multi-vector similarity queries.

Together, these scripts construct the foundation of our **BoomHQ benchmark**, enabling reproducible experiments for **Multiple Hybrid Queries (MHQ)**.

## 🔍 Query Generation

After the column expansion, we automatically construct a set of benchmark queries to evaluate the system’s ability to process **Multiple Hybrid Queries (MHQ)** — queries that combine vector similarity and scalar filtering.

The queries are generated by two scripts:

### 1️⃣ Single-Vector Hybrid Queries (`gen_single_col_query.py`)
This script creates **hybrid queries over a single vector column** combined with one or more scalar predicates.  
Each query randomly selects:

- A target vector column and query embedding (sampled from the same distribution).  
- A scalar condition (e.g., `price < 0.5`, `rating > 4.0`, or `category = 'A'`).  
- A similarity function (`L2`, `cosine`, or `dot`) and a top-`k` threshold.

The resulting workload allows the evaluation of how well different vector DBMSs handle combined vector–scalar predicates under varying selectivities.

---

### 2️⃣ Multi-Vector Hybrid Queries (`gen_mul_col_query.py`)
To simulate complex real-world search scenarios, we introduce **weighted multi-vector hybrid queries**.  
These queries involve **multiple vector columns**, each contributing to the overall similarity score:

\[
\text{score}(x, q) = \sum_i w_i \cdot \text{sim}(x_i, q_i)
\]

The script supports:

- Random or rule-based weight assignment.  
- Mixed scalar conditions (range or categorical filters).  
- Query generation for various benchmark scales.  

This enables comprehensive evaluation of **multi-aspect semantic search**, where both vector relationships and scalar attributes jointly determine query results.
